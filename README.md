#Python Meets the Polls

##Election Audit Overview

The purpose of this project was to audit the results of an election in three counties in Colorado.  We were to determine the candidates, their votes, and their percentage of the votes cast, as well as how the votes broke down for each county. For this audit, we used a python script to analyze the data held in a CSV file and the results were written into a text file.

##Election Audit Results

There were a total of 369,711 votes cast for three candidates in this election

The votes broke down for each county as follows:
-Jefferson County
-38,855 votes
-10.5% of the votes
-Denver County
-306,055 votes
-82.8% of the votes
-Arapahoe County
-24,801 votes
-6.7% of the votes

Denver county had the largest voter turnout, with 306,055 votes

**Diana DeGette won this election, receiving 272,892 votes which is 73.8% of the total votes cast.**

This can all be seen in the following image from the Election Analysis text file.

##Election Audit Summary

The results of this audit show that it is both accurate and effective to use python to analyze election data.  With some modification, this script could be used for any election. Depending on the data provided, code could be added to further break down voter patterns by party affiliation.  It could be determined how many votes per candidate came from each party, and which party had the largest turnout overall.  This could be done by adding code similar to that used to find candidate and county data.  Additionally, voter turnout could be further analyzed by zip code in the same way.  This could help the election commission to track and understand voting trends over the years.
